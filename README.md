# Press-Hear

### Welcome

#### This project about letters pronounciation and it is just a practice to me in JS.

it's a common project known as Drum Kit, but another idea jump into my head to convert it to more fun and useful
I'm not a native english speaker so I have an approach to hear the pronounciation of the new language's letters
before learning it so It counld be converted to any language, by change the letters to another language letters,
like arabic or russian or french or or or ...... in the *HTML* file

this project is **extendable**..

small note: the audio files, I got them from google translator.

**demo**  https://jsmaom.github.io/Press-Hear/
